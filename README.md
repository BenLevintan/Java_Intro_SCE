# Java_Intro_SCE

This repository contains all my assignments and classwork from the **Introduction to Coding (Java)** course, part of my first semester of **Computer Science @ SCE**.

Each file demonstrates foundational programming concepts in Java — including loops, conditionals, recursion, arrays, string manipulation, and algorithmic thinking.

## Homework 1 – Basic Java Practice
Introduces Java syntax, console I/O, loops, and conditionals.

- ex1 – Currency converter (USD → NIS)  
- ex2 – Pipe length calculator (breaking a distance into fixed pipe sizes)  
- ex3 – Triangle type checker (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene)  
- ex4 – Binary to decimal converter  
- ex5 – Pattern printer (square with custom diagonal characters)  
- ex6 – RGB color mixer (character-based)  
- ex7 – Armstrong numbers finder (in user-given range)

---

## Homework 2 – Arrays and Logical Thinking
Covers 1D/2D arrays, pattern logic, and iteration.

- ex1 – Counts the number of digit 7s in a set of numbers  
- ex2a / ex2b – Counts zeros, evens, and sevens in arrays  
- ex3 – Finds min and max from a sequence of inputs  
- ex4 – Swaps array elements based on divisibility  
- ex5 – Finds the number(s) with the most divisors  
- ex6 – Checks if all edge elements in a 4×4 array are prime  
- ex7 – Two-player Tic-Tac-Toe  
- ex8 – Sudoku validator (rows, columns, and subgrids)

---

## Homework 3 – Strings, Matrices, and Algorithms
Focuses on string manipulation, character arrays, and matrix algorithms.

- ex1 – Prints a diamond pattern using stars  
- ex2 – Checks if a number is a palindrome and/or prime; prints all numbers that are both within a range  
- ex4 – Validates an ID using checksum logic (Israeli-style)  
- ex5 – Counts uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters in a string  
- ex6 – Finds a given string in a matrix (rows, columns, diagonals)  
- ex7a – Counts words alphabetically before a given word  
- ex7b – Returns all words that alphabetically precede a given word

---

## Homework 4 – Recursion Practice
Introduces recursive logic, base cases, and memoization.

- count2(int num) – Counts how many times digit 2 appears in a number  
- isPalindrome(String str) – Recursive palindrome checker  
- sumOfDigits(int num) – Calculates sum of digits recursively  
- SumOfArray(int[] arr, int n) – Recursive array summation  
- sumIsEven(int[] arr) – Checks if array sum is even  
- power(int num) – Computes 2^num recursively  
- sumOfOddNumbers(int[] arr) – Sums all odd numbers in an array recursively  
- subsetSum(int[] arr, int sum) – Checks if a subset sums to a given target  
- tribonacciElement(int num) – Recursive Tribonacci sequence implementation  
- tribonacci(int num) – Tribonacci with memoization (lookup table)

---

## Homework 5 – Search and Sort Algorithms
Implements fundamental search and sorting algorithms in both iterative and recursive styles.

- linerSearch(String[] arr, String str) – Linear search; prints unsuccessful comparison count  
- jumpSearch(int[] arr, int key) – Jump search algorithm using recursive segmentation  
- ternarySearch(int[] arr, int key) – Iterative ternary search  
- interpolationSearch(char[] arr, char key) – Interpolation search on a descending array; prints comparison count  
- insertionSort(int[] arr) – Insertion sort (descending order); counts element swaps  
- bubbleSort(int[] arr) – Recursive bubble sort with swap count tracking  

Demonstrates various algorithmic approaches to searching and sorting while practicing control flow, efficiency, and recursion.

## Running the Code
Each `.java` file contains a `main()` method and can be run independently

---

## Tools
- Language: Java  
- Version: OpenJDK 17+  
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code  

---

## Notes
- All assignments emphasize understanding over optimization  
- Input handled via `Scanner`  
- Code style follows standard Java syntax conventions  
- Recursion and algorithmic logic are key focus points of later exercises
